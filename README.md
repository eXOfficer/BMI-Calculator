#  BMI Calculator

## What you will create

In the end, I will have made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many or if they need to eat more. 

## What I will learn

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
